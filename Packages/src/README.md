Control Unity Editor from various LLM tools.

Accelerates AI-driven development cycles to enable continuous improvement loops.

# Concept
This project was created with the concept of enabling AI-driven coding to run autonomously for as long as possible.
Normally, humans need to handle tasks like compiling Unity, running tests, and communicating logs to AI. uLoopMCP solves this hassle.

# Features
1. Simply install the package and press the button to connect to your LLM tool to start using it immediately.
2. Easily extensible functionality. You can quickly create your own custom MCP tools. (AI should be able to create them for you quickly)
3. Options are implemented to minimize context consumption.

# Tool Window
<img width="350" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5863b58b-7b48-48ae-9a40-c874ddc11488" />

 - Manages and monitors server status
 - Provides visibility into LLM tool connection status
 - Enables easy connection to tools via the LLM tool settings button

# Key Features
#### 1. compile - Execute Compilation
Performs AssetDatabase.Refresh() and then compiles, returning the results. Can detect errors and warnings that built-in linters cannot find.  
You can choose between incremental compilation and forced full compilation.
```
→ Execute compile, analyze error and warning content
→ Automatically fix relevant files
→ Verify with compile again
```

#### 2. get-logs - Retrieve Logs Same as Unity Console
Filter by LogType or search target string. You can also choose whether to include stacktrace.
This allows you to retrieve logs while keeping the context small.
**MaxCount behavior**: Returns the latest logs (tail-like behavior). When MaxCount=10, returns the most recent 10 logs.
```
→ get-logs (LogType: Error, SearchText: "NullReference", MaxCount: 10)
→ Identify cause from stacktrace, fix relevant code
```

#### 3. run-tests - Execute TestRunner (PlayMode, EditMode supported)
Executes Unity Test Runner and retrieves test results. You can set conditions with FilterType and FilterValue.
- FilterType: all (all tests), exact (individual test method name), regex (class name or namespace), assembly (assembly name)
- FilterValue: Value according to filter type (class name, namespace, etc.)  
Test results can be output as xml. The output path is returned so AI can read it.  
This is also a strategy to avoid consuming context.
```
→ run-tests (FilterType: exact, FilterValue: "io.github.hatayama.uLoopMCP.ConsoleLogRetrieverTests.GetAllLogs_WithMaskAllOff_StillReturnsAllLogs")
→ Check failed tests, fix implementation to pass tests
```
> [!WARNING]
> During PlayMode test execution, Domain Reload is forcibly turned OFF. Note that static variables will not be reset.

#### 4. clear-console - Log Cleanup
Clear logs that become noise during log searches.
```
→ clear-console
→ Start new debug session
```

#### 5. unity-search - Project Search with UnitySearch
You can use [UnitySearch](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/search-overview.html).
```
→ unity-search (SearchQuery: "*.prefab")
→ List prefabs matching specific conditions
→ Identify problematic prefabs
```

#### 6. get-provider-details - Check UnitySearch Search Providers
Retrieve search providers offered by UnitySearch.
```
→ Understand each provider's capabilities, choose optimal search method
```

#### 7. get-menu-items - Retrieve Menu Items
Retrieve menu items defined with [MenuItem("xxx")] attribute. Can filter by string specification.

#### 8. execute-menu-item - Execute Menu Items
Execute menu items defined with [MenuItem("xxx")] attribute.
```
→ Have AI generate test program
→ execute-menu-item (MenuItemPath: "Tools/xxx") to execute generated test program
→ Check results with get-logs
```

#### 9. find-game-objects - Search Scene Objects
Retrieve objects and examine component parameters.
```
→ find-game-objects (RequiredComponents: ["Camera"])
→ Investigate Camera component parameters
```

#### 10. get-hierarchy - Analyze Scene Structure
Retrieve information about the currently active Hierarchy in nested JSON format. Works at runtime as well.
**Automatic File Export**: Large hierarchies (>100KB) are automatically saved to `{project_root}/uLoopMCPOutputs/HierarchyResults/` directory to minimize token consumption.
```
→ Understand parent-child relationships between GameObjects, discover and fix structural issues
→ For large scenes, hierarchy data is saved to file and path is returned instead of raw JSON
```

<summary>Manual Setup (Usually Unnecessary)</summary>

> [!NOTE]
> Usually automatic setup is sufficient, but if needed, you can manually edit the configuration file (e.g., `mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "uLoopMCP": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "[Unity Package Path]/TypeScriptServer~/dist/server.bundle.js"
      ],
      "env": {
        "UNITY_TCP_PORT": "{port}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Path Examples**:

> [!NOTE]
> When installed via Package Manager, the package is placed in `Library/PackageCache` with a hashed directory name. Using the "Auto Configure Cursor" button will automatically set the correct path.

</details>

5. Multiple Unity Instance Support
> [!NOTE]
> Multiple Unity instances can be supported by changing port numbers. uLoopMCP automatically assigns unused ports when starting up.

## Prerequisites

The following software is required:
- **Unity 2022.3 or later**
- **Node.js 18.0 or later** - Required for MCP server execution
- Install Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

## Installation

### Via Unity Package Manager

1. Open Unity Editor
2. Open Window > Package Manager
3. Click the "+" button
4. Select "Add package from git URL"
5. Enter the following URL:
```
https://github.com/hatayama/uLoopMCP.git?path=/Packages/src
```

### Via OpenUPM (Recommended)

### Using Scoped registry in Unity Package Manager
1. Open Project Settings window and go to Package Manager page
2. Add the following entry to the Scoped Registries list:
```
Name: OpenUPM

```

3. Open Package Manager window and select OpenUPM in the My Registries section. uLoopMCP will be displayed.

## Project-Specific Tool Development
uLoopMCP enables efficient development of project-specific MCP tools without requiring changes to the core package.  
The type-safe design allows for reliable custom tool implementation in minimal time.

<details>
<summary>View Implementation Guide</summary>

You can easily add project-specific tools without modifying the core package.

**Step 1: Create Schema Class** (define parameters):
```csharp
using System.ComponentModel;

public class MyCustomSchema : BaseToolSchema
{
    [Description("Parameter description")]
    public string MyParameter { get; set; } = "default_value";
    
    [Description("Example enum parameter")]
    public MyEnum EnumParameter { get; set; } = MyEnum.Option1;
}

public enum MyEnum
{
    Option1 = 0,
    Option2 = 1,
    Option3 = 2
}
```

**Step 2: Create Response Class** (define return data):
```csharp
public class MyCustomResponse : BaseToolResponse
{
    public string Result { get; set; }
    public bool Success { get; set; }
    
    public MyCustomResponse(string result, bool success)
    {
        Result = result;
        Success = success;
    }
    
    // Required parameterless constructor
    public MyCustomResponse() { }
}
```

**Step 3: Create Tool Class**:
```csharp
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

[McpTool(Description = "Description of my custom tool")]  // ← Auto-registered with this attribute
public class MyCustomTool : AbstractUnityTool<MyCustomSchema, MyCustomResponse>
{
    public override string ToolName => "my-custom-tool";
    
    // Executed on main thread
    protected override Task<MyCustomResponse> ExecuteAsync(MyCustomSchema parameters, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        // Type-safe parameter access
        string param = parameters.MyParameter;
        MyEnum enumValue = parameters.EnumParameter;
        
        // Check for cancellation before long-running operations
        cancellationToken.ThrowIfCancellationRequested();
        
        // Implement custom logic here
        string result = ProcessCustomLogic(param, enumValue);
        bool success = !string.IsNullOrEmpty(result);
        
        // For long-running operations, periodically check for cancellation
        // cancellationToken.ThrowIfCancellationRequested();
        
        return Task.FromResult(new MyCustomResponse(result, success));
    }
    
    private string ProcessCustomLogic(string input, MyEnum enumValue)
    {
        // Implement custom logic
        return $"Processed '{input}' with enum '{enumValue}'";
    }
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Important Notes**:
> - **Timeout Handling**: All tools inherit `TimeoutSeconds` parameter from `BaseToolSchema`. Implement `cancellationToken.ThrowIfCancellationRequested()` checks in long-running operations to ensure proper timeout behavior.
> - **Thread Safety**: Tools execute on Unity's main thread, so Unity API calls are safe without additional synchronization.

Please also refer to [Custom Tool Samples](/Assets/Editor/CustomToolSamples).

</details>

## Other
> [!TIP]
> **File Output**
> The `run-tests`, `unity-search`, and `get-hierarchy` tools can save results to the `{project_root}/uLoopMCPOutputs/` directory to avoid massive token consumption when dealing with large datasets.
> **Recommendation**: Add `uLoopMCPOutputs/` to `.gitignore` to exclude from version control.

> [!TIP]
> **Automatic MCP Execution in Cursor**
> By default, Cursor requires user permission when executing MCP.
> To disable this, go to Cursor Settings > Chat > MCP Tools Protection and turn it Off.
> Note that this cannot be controlled per MCP type or tool, so all MCPs will no longer require permission. This is a security tradeoff, so please configure it with that in mind.

> [!WARNING]
> **Windows Claude Code**
